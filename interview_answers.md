# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What are the main differences between a stateful and a functional component?
    Stateful components have a state built in while functional components do not. However, functional components can replicate actions performed by stateful components through the use of hooks.

2. When does a componentWillMount function be called? What about a componentWillUpdate?
    componentWillMount is called just before the component mounts. componentWillUpdate is called just before rerendering due to state or prop changes.

3. Define stateful logic.
    Stateful logic is any code that modifies the state.

4. What are the three step of creating a successful test? What is done in each phase?
    Arrange: setting up the test case
    Act: executing the behavior being tested
    Assert: extracting the effects of the execution and checking if satisfactory.
